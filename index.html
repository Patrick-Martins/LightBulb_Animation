    <p>Light was always a part of our history , from the revolutionary discovery of the fire to its use on candles and
      gas lamps, which presented their benefits and hazards but not as futuristic as the electric light bulb. </p>

    <p>Between 1878 and 1880, Edison and his associates worked seriously to develop the light bulb. They worked on at
      least 3000 different theories for developing an efficient incandescent lamp.</p>

  <template class="process-curiosity">
    <p>Incandescent lamps make light by using electricity to heat a thin strip of material, called filament, until it
      gets hot enough to glow.</p>

  </template>

  <template class="process-conclusion">
    <p>By 1879 Edison managed to create his first electric light, which burned for a few short hours. In order to
      improve the bulb, Edison tested over 6000 materials for the filament!</p>

    <p>Edison discovered that when using bamboo as the filament, the bulb could burn for 1200 hours! The bamboo became
      the standard filament for the next 10 years.</p>

  <template class="work-impact">
    <p>The 24 hours working time was possible since the light bulb became more popular and we became less dependent on
      the time of the day. The increase of the working hours had a huge impact in the economy since more working time
      meant more productivity for companies and more money flowing in the economy. Increased luminescence in the
      workplace helped make it easier for laborers to see potential workplace hazards, thus preventing accidents and
      making workplaces safer.</p>

  <template class="lifestyle-impact">
    <p>Many people found that increased nighttime luminosity made it possible to enjoy leisure activities late into the
      night.Candles and oil-based lamps were dangerous fire hazards, leading to many yearly deaths. The light bulb made
      for a safer nighttime home environment.</p>

  <template class="technology">
    <p>In 1882 the world's first coal-fired public power station, the Edison Electric Light Station, was built in
      London, a project of Thomas Edison organized by Edward Johnson. In September 1882 in New York, the Pearl Street
      Station was established by Edison to provide electric lighting in the lower Manhattan Island area. Plugs and
      sockets for portable appliances started becoming available in the 1880s.</p>
